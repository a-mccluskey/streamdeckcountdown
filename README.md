# streamdeckcountdown

V0.2

A continuation of the javascript project twitchlightdash. Is pre-release type software, but it works. Currently a countdown timer that resets everytime the button is pressed.
Based on the analog clock example from elgato's SDK.

There are three main settings, hydration & eyestrain - counts down for 20 mins with a blue and green semicircle, and a stretch - countsdown for 60 mins with a red needle.

Requirements:
Streamdeck software V4.1+
Streamdeck, or streamdeck mini.

Todo:
set the title dependant on which setting is chose.
Bug squash.
background image.
Add custom timer to the Property inspector.

Known issues:
the clock resets and the settings are lost when you go into another folder or restart the streamdeck app.
